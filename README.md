## Nearest Neighbours Inspired Foraging Control Strategy for Green Disk Collection

Developing modular systems as opposed to
specific systems can help save time and allow for reusability. A
modular foraging control strategy is developed and tested using
a single robot and multiple robots for the collection of disks in
an area. The results of the simulation show a high collection
rate with multiple modular robots. However, collection speed is
limited by the choice of a camera. Advanced image processing
techniques and additional sensing can reduce collection time
significantly.
